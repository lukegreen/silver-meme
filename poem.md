*Tyger Tyger, burning bright,*<br> 
In the forests of the night;<br> 
What immortal hand or eye,<br> 
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?<br>

In what distant deeps or skies.<br> 
Burnt the fire of thine eyes?<br>
On what wings dare he aspire?<br>
What the hand, dare seize the fire?<br>

And what shoulder, & what art,<br>
Could twist the sinews of thy heart?<br>
And when thy heart began to beat,<br>
What dread hand? & what dread feet?<br>

What the hammer? what the chain, <br>
In what furnace was thy brain?<br>
What the anvil? what dread grasp, <br>
Dare its deadly terrors clasp! <br>

When the stars threw down their spears <br>
And water'd heaven with their tears: <br>
Did he smile his work to see?<br>
Did he who made the Lamb make thee?<br>

Tyger Tyger burning bright, <br>
In the forests of the night: <br>
What immortal hand or eye,<br>
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?<br><br>
